# Grid Experiments

This is a set of experiments using CSS grid to emulate magazine design styles. The goal here is not to go overboard with tweaking colors, fonts, or anything "fancy". It's just to play with CSS grid by going from pre-designed layouts and inferring how they might be created. To do this, it's also necessary to decide how the mobile layout might look if it had been created. I set two restrictions for myself so I wouldn't go overboard.

1. I had to complete the layout part of each project in an hour or less.
2. The CSS files couldn't be more than about 200 lines.

These restrictions are of course completely arbitrary and a little silly, but it helps to have some boundaries sometimes.

NB - The "navigation" part of each is just there to get around easily. I don't consider it part of the experiment.
